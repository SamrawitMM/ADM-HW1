# ADMHW1Problem1

This repository contains solutions for various problems from the **HackerRank Platform**, covering sections on **Introduction, Basic Data Types, Strings, Sets, Collections, Regular Expressions, Built-in Functions, and DateTime**, along with specific problem solutions for algorithmic challenges. The problems are solved in Python.

## Sections

### 1. Introduction
- Basic introduction problems to get started with coding on HackerRank.

### 2. Basic Data Types
- Solutions for problems dealing with Python's basic data types.

### 3. Strings
- Solutions for common string manipulation problems like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

### 4. Sets
- Problems related to set operations, including union, intersection, and difference.

### 5. Collections
- Problems using Python's `collections` module such as `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, and others.

### 6. Regular Expressions
- Solutions to problems that require matching patterns in strings using regular expressions.

### 7. Built-in Functions
- Solutions utilizing Python's built-in functions for solving various tasks efficiently.

### 8. DateTime
- Date and time-related problems using Python's `datetime` module to manipulate and calculate time differences.

## Specific Problem Solutions

### 1. Birthday Cake Candles
- **Description:** Find the number of tallest candles on a birthday cake.
- **Solution:** Implemented to iterate through the list of candles, finding the maximum height and counting how many candles have that height.

### 2. Number Line Jumps
- **Description:** Determine if two kangaroos starting at different positions and jumping different distances will land at the same location after the same number of jumps.
- **Solution:** Implemented using mathematical conditions to check if the kangaroos meet at any point.

### 3. Viral Advertising
- **Description:** Track the number of people who liked an advertisement over a period of days, where the number of shares triples each day.
- **Solution:** Implemented by simulating the progression of people who like and share the advertisement.

### 4. Recursive Digit Sum
- **Description:** Calculate the super digit of a number, where the super digit is found by recursively summing the digits until a single digit is obtained.
- **Solution:** Implemented using recursion and mathematical operations to break down the problem.

### 5. Insertion Sort - Part 1
- **Description:** Perform the first step of insertion sort by moving an unsorted element to its correct position in a sorted sublist.
- **Solution:** Implemented by shifting elements and inserting the target element in the correct position.

### 6. Insertion Sort - Part 2
- **Description:** Complete the entire insertion sort algorithm for sorting a list.
- **Solution:** Implemented using the insertion sort technique, iterating over the list and placing elements in the correct sorted position.
